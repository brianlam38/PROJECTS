	PART 1 - INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE LEARNING
*/

Machine Learning
- Grew out of work in AI
- New capabilities for computers

// EXAMPLES
Database Mining
- Large datasets from growth of automation / web.
- E.g. Web click data ("Click Stream Data"), medical records,
	biology (E.g. "Computational biology"), engineering.

Applications that can't be programmed by hand.
- Autonomous helicopters (too difficult to program this, need to have a computer learn how by itself)
- Handwriting recognition (learning algorithm, to read your handwriting so it can auto-route your mail)
- most of Natural Langauge Processing (NLP) (Use of AI to understand language)
- Computer Vision (Use of AI to understand images)

Self-Customising Programs
- Amazon, Netflix product recommendation (using learning algorithms)
--> There is NO way to write a million different programs for a million users.
--> The only way is to have software to give customised recommendations is to have the program LEARN BY ITSELF.

Understand Human Learning / The Brain

// Machine Learning Jobs
There are vast, unfulfilled machine learning jobs available.
- Lecturer is contacted by recruiters w/ more demand than supply of graduating machine learning students.

/*
	SUPERVISED LEARNING - The most common type of machine learning
*/

// Predicting Housing Prices
Person collects datasets from a city and plots a data set.
- Person is hoping to sell a house there and want to know much they can get.
- How can the learning algorithm help you?
--> A L.A can put a STRAIGHT LINE through the data
--> Another L.A can fit a QUADRATIC FUNCTION through the data (more accurate prediction?)
--> How do we choose, whether we want to fit a STIRAIGHT LINE vs QUADRATIC FUNCTION?
